# Advanced ASIC Design Flow using Openlane and Skywater 130nm PDKs

Welcome to the Advanced ASIC Design Flow and Fabrication Process repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding advanced ASIC design methodologies, fabrication processes, and the utilization of open-source tools for ASIC design.

## Introduction

I am Boddu Ajay, and I've created this repository as an output of the Advanced ASIC Design course offered by the VLSI System Design(VSD). Throughout the course, I've gained valuable insights into the intricacies of ASIC design, focusing particularly on open-source solutions such as OpenLane and Google SkyWater 130nm PDK.

## About This Repository

In this repository, you'll find a wealth of resources related to advanced ASIC design, fabrication processes and Opensource ASIC design using Openlane flow and opensource Google Skywater 130nm PDKs.
